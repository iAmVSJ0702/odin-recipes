    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Breakfast, lunch, tea time, and dinner - this popular Indian pancake is available for a meal or snack. As kids we ate it sprinkled with sugar. It's typically served with curry and sambal if you choose to spice it up.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
        <li>4 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ tablespoons clarified butter (ghee)</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter), divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix warm water, salt, and sugar together in a bowl. Put flour in a large mixing bowl; work in 3 1/2 tablespoons ghee using your fingertips.</li>
        <li>Beat egg and 1 teaspoon water together in a bowl; add to flour mixture. Gradually mix warm water mixture into flour mixture while kneading until dough becomes soft and pliable. Form dough into balls and let rest in a well-oiled bowl, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Working on a flat greased surface, take a dough ball and flatten it using the heel of your palm to make a paper-thin circle. Spread 1 teaspoon ghee inside it. Fold the edges together to make roti into a square. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1 tablespoon ghee on griddle or in a skillet over medium heat; cook roti until browned, 1 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
